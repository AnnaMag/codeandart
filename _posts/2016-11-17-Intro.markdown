# Outreachy & Node.js

I'm thrilled to have become the Outreachy grantee in the Decemeber 2016- March 2017
round.  These pages were set up to document the learnings and the process
of contributing to the Node.js core.

V8 (Node's JS engine) has been updated with a new API, which will
land in the Node.js core in the very near future. It will allow for replacing
current deprecated functions and workaround solutions in Node.js.


The project I am working on is "Improve the vm module in Node.js core".
Vm is a sandboxed V8 instance, which allows to contextify processes run in Node.
There are a number of issues in Contextify, which can be solved by adopting
the changes in the new V8 API. That's the outline- looking forward to seeing
it evolve and getting implemented.
