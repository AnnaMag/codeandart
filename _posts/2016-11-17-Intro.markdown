# Outreachy & Node.js

The blog was set up to document my process of open source contributions to Node.js.
I'm thrilled to have become the Outreachy grantee and the opportunity of diving head
first into contributing to such a complex codebase as Node.js. It is widely used,
with amazingly skilled and experienced maintainers and developers.
I can't think of a greater learning experience.

The project I'll be working on is entitled "Improve the vm module in Node.js core",
menored by Franziska Hinkelmann (Google, Node.js). During the application process
we managed to introduce a couple off improvements which landed in the core (yay!).
What's the goal of the project, really?
In brief, V8 (Node's JS engine) has been updated with a new API, which will
replace the current V8 version of Node.js in the near future.
The overarching theme of this project is to use the new V8 API to replace
current deprecated functions and workaround solutions in Node.js.
Vm is a sandboxed V8 instance, which allows to contextify processes run in Node.
There are a number of issues in Contextify, which can be solved by adopting
the changes in the new V8 API. That's the outline- looking forward to seeing
it evolve and getting implemented.

Writing posts about the progress and learnings is a few notches away from my comfort
zone- again, no better reason to do it. The official start date is the 6th of December.
I'm busy tinkering with the V8 API and reading/watching all I can find on Node.js.
Off for a great start.
