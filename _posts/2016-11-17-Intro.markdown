# Outreachy & Node.js
[Outreachy](https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreachy) is an amazing initiative
providing underrepresented communities in tech an opportunity
to get involved in FOSS. Participating organizations
vary with each call. It is a unique opportunity to contribute to organizations like Mozilla,
Wikimedia, Fedora, Linux kernel, GNOME, amongst many others.

The application process is highly collaborative and its main component are
the initial contributions to the project of choice, with the help of the mentor
and the community. I had a blast during the application process and
highly recommend it to those who are curious to understand how important projects
and software are designed, created and maintained; and who want to seriously up
the ante when it comes to their programming skills.

I learned about the Outreachy at the awesome NYC-based [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) this spring (another 'I cannot recommend it
highly enough' choice). I'm beyond thrilled to have become the Outreachy grantee in the December 2016 - March 2017 round working on Node.js. Being both Javascript and C++ fan
with deep interest in complex systems, Node.js was a natural choice for me.
These pages were set up to document the learnings and the contribution process.

# "Improving the vm module in Node.js core".
Node.js uses V8 as its JavaScript runtime-- every Node.js release ships
with a specific V8 version. The new 5.5 V8 API supports more of the ES6 syntax
in comparison with its predecessors (think e.g. Object.defineProperty),
which allows for removing some of the deprecated functions and workaround solutions in
the current version of Node.js core. In particular,
[vm](https://nodejs.org/api/vm.html), a sandboxed V8 instance,
will benefit a great deal from the upgrade, which is my focus in the coming weeks.

Looking forward to seeing the project evolve and get implemented. Exciting!
