These days I optimized my workflow. I realized the amount of time
I could save by automation and smart tool choice. One can only get
as far with half-baked workflow.

I slowly learn more keyboard shortcuts (```ctrl+R``` is ma fav).
I added git aliases to the .zshrc file and cleaned up branches
from previous PRs. Coincidental github push of my messy local node fork
:cold_sweat: directory was a strong incentive to clean it up
and reorganize some of the half written notes and
scrapbooking files.
I added a bash script to copy builds into a special directory that is
not under version
control and rename them accordingly to avoid overwriting. Node.js build
softlinks executables from */out/Release* and */out/Debug*, so that
they get overwritten with every build made off any branch.
Obvious thing, it seems, yet it takes a few re-builds and
"oh geee's" to realize what is happening
:disappointed:.


I was using a homebrew installation of Node.js (aside from my local builds).
Following my mentor's advice I switched to ```nvm```. I installed ```nvm```
from homebrew, removed the few npm-globally-installed packages (not the best
   practice to go ```npm -g``` with node packages) and used it
   to re-installed ```npm```
and current stable releases of Node.js versions.
```nvm``` puts its files in a *.nvm/* folder in the home directory.
I did not build it from source, which contains a few utility files.
For the sake of convenience, I copied the ```nvm.sh``` and ```bash_completion``` from
```nvm``` [github repo](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) and placed them
in *.nvm/*. It allows to load commands without a need for sourcing
and adds tab completion.
The benefit of using ```nvm``` is to be able to install and easily switch
between different Node.js versions. In addition, one can run distinct
releases in different tabs, which is great for tests.

I cleaned my desk to have only my laptop and a notebook on it :smile:.
Clear space = clear mind, as the zen masters have been saying all along.
A major game-changer was getting in a habit of preparing a to-do list
at the end of my work for the day, so that I can jump start the following morning
by ticking things off of it (after my meditation and yoga practice, that is),
instead of trying to figure out tasks and their priorities.

You live and you learn-- getting better each day
:heart_eyes:.
I really enjoy my work. Every day I get to do what I love most-
learn, solve problems and collaborate with extremely smart and talented people.
All that in a stunning setting-- yesterday we had another amazing sunset
in this lovely southern Portuguese town I call home.

Lucky and grateful!
