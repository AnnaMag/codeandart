These days I optimized my workflow. I realized the amount of time
I could save by putting more thought into how I work and keeping things neat.

I put more attention into memorizing shortcuts (```ctrl+R``` is ma fav).
I added git aliases to the .zshrc file and cleaned up branches
from previous PRs. Coincidental github push of my messy local node fork
:face with cold sweat: directory made me clean up the directory of some half written notes, posts and
scrapbooking files.
I added a bash script to copy builds into a special directory that is not under version
control and rename them accordingly to avoid overwriting. Node build softlinks
executables from /out/Release and /out/Debug, so that they get overwritten
with every build made off any branch. Obvious thing, but it takes a few
"oh geee's" to realize what is happening and that another re-build is needed
:disappointed:.


I was using a homebrew installation of Node.js (aside from my local builds).
Following my mentor's advice I switched to ```nvm```. I installed ```nvm```
from homebrew, removed the few npm-globally-installed packages (not the best
   practice to go ```npm -g``` with node packages) and used it to re-installed ```npm```
and current stable releases of Node.js versions.
```nvm``` puts its files in a *.nvm/* folder of home directory.
For the sake of convenience, considering that I did not build ```nvm``` from
source, I copied the ```nvm.sh``` and ```bash_completion``` from
```nvm``` [github repo](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) and placed them
in *.nvm/*. It allows to load commands without a need for sourcing
and adds tab completion.

I cleaned my desk to have only my laptop and a notebook on it :smile:.
Clear space clear mind, as the zen masters have been saying all along.
A major game-changer was getting in a habit of writing down things as I go
(and not plainly keeping them in mind) and  preparing a to-do list
at the end of my work for the day, so I can jump start the following morning
by ticking things off of it (after my meditation and yoga practice, that is),
instead of trying to figure out what it was that had the biggest priority.

You live and you learn-- getting better each day
:heart_eyes:.
I really enjoy my work. Every day I get to do what I love most-
learn, solve problems and collaborate with extremely smart and talented people.
All that in a stunning setting-- yesterday we had another amazing sunset
in this lovely southern Portuguese town I call home.

Lucky and grateful!
